            <h3>Why should I support OPTC-info?</h3>
            <p>As fan-project, OPTC-info is made in my free time and I simply enjoy doing it.</p>
            <p>However, it's very time-consuming to make nice-looking crafts and in order to deliver them before Christmas, I skipped my OPTC play-time, weekends and even sleep last few weeks :D<br>
                I polished them good enough for use, but there is room for improvements.</p>

            <p>With some community support, I could turn down a bit of extra work and redeem myself time to make things we all enjoy instead :)</p>
            <p><b>You have no obligation to help the project in any way. All content is free for personal use. It's entirely up to you. But I'll be very thankful and keep doing nice stuff.</b></p>

            <h4>I'll be clear about my plans on donations:</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Finish 2018 Calendar update and make some sets.</li>
                <li>Print OPTC Playing Cards and Calendar for myself. <small>Can't afford them atm :(</small></li>
                <li>New Checklist is kinda raw. Need to add instruction, etc.</li>
                <li>Buy Starter set with grd. legend <small><i>Cabbage or Ace pls *_*</i></small></li>
                <li>Feature to save Checklist finally! <small>unless someone help with it on GitHub sooner</small></li>
                <li>I want to update cards with better typography etc. <small>low priority</small></li>
                <li><strike>Maybe finally pull something decent on anni.</strike> Save up for my life-changing plans next year *_*</li>
