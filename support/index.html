           <h3>Why Support OPTC-info?</h3>
           <p>As fan-project, OPTC-info is made in my free time and I simply enjoy doing it.</p>
           <p>However, it's very time-consuming to make nice-looking crafts and in order to deliver them before Christmas, I skipped my OPTC play-time, weekends and even sleep last few weeks :D<br>
                I polished them good enough for use, but there is room for improvements.</p>

           <p>With some community support, I could turn down a bit of extra work and redeem myself time to make things we all enjoy instead :)</p>
