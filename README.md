### What's new?

* Checklist 2.0:
  * _**Bigger!** Portraits are now a bit bigger, also no frames at all, use whole screen. To fit more for screenshot - zoom out, columns will adjust._
  * _**Faster!** Simply structure, only needed code. Loading faster \o/_
  * _**Public!** You can access code via GitHub and clone it or offer some help! Yay!_

### Small Q&A
**Q: What happened to previous site?**

**A:** I hosted optc.info on my own hosting I used for many projects, work and hobby. Some time ago I had to close it with all the projects.

**Q: Why it took so long to move the checklist?**

**A:** There were 2 reasons for that:

1. The way I made it. It was part of the site, using some of framework features, so it required extra time to remake it and made it impossible to just pass it to someone as is.

2. Well, I had bigger issues to deal with when couldn't even pay for hosting. Sorry, it sucks.

**Q: Can Checklist just die again any time?!**

**A: Nope, I took care of it.** OPTC-info is on Github Pages now, it's free forever and won't go anywhere. Also, everyone have access to source code and Checklist is now fully portable. It only consists of 3 files.
